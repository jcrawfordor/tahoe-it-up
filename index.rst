Welcome to Tahoe
----------------

I'm a member of a private Tahoe cluster. In the course of inviting new participants, we discovered that while Tahoe is really pretty easy to use, there isn't a lot of good documentation to point new users towards. So I decided to try and change that. This manual will first help you hit the ground running by walking you through installing Tahoe and creating a client connected to a cluster. Then it'll explain Tahoe fundamentals and show you how to actually store, retrieve, and manage files. Finally it will show you how to set up a storage node, and discuss some advanced configurations.
